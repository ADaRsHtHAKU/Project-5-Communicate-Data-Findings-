Prosper Loan Data Exploration

Dataset
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower income, and many others. This data dictionary explains the variables in the data set. Project objective is not expected to explore all of the variables in the dataset! But focus on only exploration on about 10-15 of them.

Summary 
•Loan Status of all Borrowers are with current and completed state.
•Majority of the loan applicants are from 50K to 75K range with employed status. 
•The distribution of monthly income from applicants is a right skewed because there will be some of applicants with high salary.  
•Employment Status of all the Borrowers are with the Employed State.
•Applicants with income range of 50K to 75K range have their grow rating falling under AA, A, B and C.
•Loan Status with current and completed have own homes when they applied for loans
•The monthly income of borrowers are having higher values for employed, and other full time employment status with the prosper rating of AA, A and B.
• Observed that without home owner tend to have a higher interest rate, and thus lower rating. However home owner tends to have lower interest rate and higher rating. So home owner is safest bet when giving a loan. We can also clearly observe that HR grow rating applicants have higher interest rates.

Key Insights for Presentation
I focused mainly with the features that are impactful for approval of loan status I start by looking at the distribution of each and every numeric and categorical variables and did all the necessary univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis on the selected variables.
The major insights obtained are:
•Loan Status of all Borrowers are with current and completed.
•Top Income Range of all Borrowers are within $50,000-74,999.
 •Majority of the borrowers are with an occupation of Professional and Executive.
•Majority of the borrowers are with a rating is from 4 to 8.
•The borrowers rate follow an approximately unimodal distribution, with the peak around 0.16. •The origination amount of the loan is interesting. Here we see that the distribution is a right skewed with multiple peaks observed at 4000 USD, 10000 USD and 15000 USD.
 •Loan original amount and monthly loan payment is highly correlated and it is expected and borrowers interest rate and proper score are highly correlated (-vely), Borrower interest rate and loan amount are -vely correlated.
We can ay that the loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on Income Range, Home owner status and employment status.
